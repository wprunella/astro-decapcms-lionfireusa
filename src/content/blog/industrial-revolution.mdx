The period between 1820-1870 saw America transition from an agrarian society to an industrial powerhouse. Key developments included:

- Expansion of railroads (30,000 miles by 1860)
- Growth of textile manufacturing in New England
- Invention of the telegraph by Samuel Morse
- Development of interchangeable parts

This economic transformation laid the foundation for America's 20th century global dominance.
