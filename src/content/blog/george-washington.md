# George Washington: The Indispensable Man

## Early Life
Born on February 22, 1732, in Westmoreland County, Virginia, George Washington was the first child of Augustine Washington and his second wife, Mary Ball Washington. His father died when George was 11, leaving him to inherit Ferry Farm and ten slaves.

## Military Career
Washington's military career began in the French and Indian War where he gained valuable experience. His leadership during the American Revolution was crucial to the colonies' victory over Britain.

## Presidency
As the first U.S. president (1789-1797), Washington set many precedents for the office. He established the cabinet system, maintained neutrality in foreign affairs, and stepped down after two terms - a tradition that lasted until FDR.

## Legacy
Washington is remembered as the "Father of His Country" for his pivotal role in the nation's founding. His Farewell Address remains one of the most significant documents in American political history.
