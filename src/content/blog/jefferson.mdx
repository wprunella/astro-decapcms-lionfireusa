Thomas Jefferson's contributions to America include:

- Principal author of Declaration of Independence
- Louisiana Purchase (1803)
- Lewis and Clark Expedition
- Founder of University of Virginia
- Advocate for religious freedom

Despite his democratic ideals, Jefferson's ownership of slaves remains a troubling contradiction in his legacy.
