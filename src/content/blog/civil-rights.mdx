The Civil Rights Movement (1954-1968) transformed American society through:

- Brown v. Board of Education (1954)
- Montgomery Bus Boycott (1955-56)
- March on Washington (1963)
- Civil Rights Act (1964)
- Voting Rights Act (1965)

Martin Luther King Jr.'s leadership and philosophy of nonviolent protest became the movement's moral compass.
