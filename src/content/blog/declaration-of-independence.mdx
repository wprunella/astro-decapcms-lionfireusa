The Declaration of Independence, adopted on July 4, 1776, marked the birth of the United States as an independent nation. Drafted primarily by Thomas Jefferson, this revolutionary document articulated the colonies' grievances against British rule and established the philosophical foundation for American democracy.

### Key Principles
- All men are created equal
- Unalienable rights to life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness
- Government derives power from the consent of the governed

The Declaration's influence extends far beyond 1776, inspiring democratic movements worldwide and shaping America's national identity.
