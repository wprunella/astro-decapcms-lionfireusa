The Santa Clara Valley's transformation into Silicon Valley began with:

- Stanford University's research programs
- Fairchild Semiconductor's founding (1957)
- The rise of Intel (1968)
- Homebrew Computer Club (1975)
- Apple's founding (1976)

Today, Silicon Valley accounts for 1/3 of all US venture capital investment.
